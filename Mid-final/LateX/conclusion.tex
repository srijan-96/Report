Our Advanced HTML Xblock provides a great platform to increase interactivity of the courses and
enhance the learning experience of the students. It is a great tool for text-savvy course content
creators as it provides them with total control over the course content. In contrast to the present text
editor in edx-platform, functionalities of our Xblock are merely limited to the imagination of the
course author. It will be a great addition to the current working lists of Xblocks present in Open edX
and will considerably boost the user experience.
