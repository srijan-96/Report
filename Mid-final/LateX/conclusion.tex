\chapter{Conclusion}
Delivering the course content to learners in better ways is most important in any educational system.
In present online education system, the successful completion rate of a course is very less.
XBlocks can be used to provide the  interface to deliver the course content in better ways to
attract the learners and deliver courses in a modular way.

Our Advanced HTML Xblock provides a great platform to increase the  interactivity of the courses and
enhance the learning experience of the students. It is a great tool for text-intent course content
creators as it provides them with total control over the course content. In contrast to the present text
editor in edx-platform, functionalities of our Xblock are merely limited to the imagination of the
course author. It will be a great addition to the current working lists of Xblocks present in Open edX
and will considerably boost the user experience.
