\chapter{Introduction}

Open edX is a widely used and very popular MOOC platform. The Open edX software is a opensource
technology that makes learning easier and studying faster. It was created by MIT and
Harvard University, and was quick to gain support of universities such as UC Berkely, Georgetown,
and Stanford.
The software platform is designed to engage students and teachers in an interactive, modular way. It
promotes active learning by video snippets, interactive components and game-like experience. The
course content is presented through learning sequences: a set of interwoven videos, readings,
discussions, wikis, collaborative and social media tools, exercises and materials with automatic
assessments and instant feedback.
The Open edX project is a global success. It powers major MOOC initiatives, hosting blended and
online courses, all around the world.
