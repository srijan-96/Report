\begin{abstract}
The project focuses on enhancing the open edx html component. Current html component does not
allow a fully fledged html, css and javascript content to be added in course. Also the html editor of
the current component is not very user friendly and lacks some fundamental functionalities such as
code indentation, code folding etc. Our first approaach was to modify openedx system itself and
thus changing the html editor for all users. Lateron we decided to move to devloping an xblock for
this and hence making it optional. We also added extra features to enahance the functionality of
xblock. These extra features include live previewing the html content along with editor.
